title: Python Code Generation & Distributed Deep Learning Frameworks 

summary: C3.ai Plaform Engineering Lunch & Learn
abstract: We demo our work on developing a transpiler for Python code generation to avoid serialization of large arrays across languages, improving performance up to 4000x. We also discuss our research on open-source distributed deep learning frameworks and design of end-to-end integrations with the platform.
