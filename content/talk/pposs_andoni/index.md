title: Low Hop Emulators and Uncapacitated Min-Cost Flow

summary: PPoSS Planning Group
abstract: "Andoni, Stein, and Zhong presented the first parallel algorithm for approximate single source shortest paths (SSSP) in nearly optimal work and depth (STOC 2020). We review their construction of a low hop emulator that approximates the graph well, reduction of SSSP to uncapacitated minimum cost flow, and introduction of a fast preconditioner into Sherman's framework (SODA 2017). We emphasize practical implementation considerations, including a discussion on a scalable implementation for one of the main subroutines: given a vertex, find its closest neighbors."
