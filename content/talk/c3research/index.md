title: Graph Algorithms with Sparse Linear Algebra

summary: C3.ai Plaform Engineering
abstract: We explore several examples that highlight the relationship between graph algorithms and sparse linear algebra. First, we build basic algebraic machinery and review all pairs shortest paths as a motivating example. We then examine matrix multiplication from a variety of algorithmic lenses, including parallel/distributed and sparse data. Next, we discuss our recent work on scalable algorithms for computing a minimum spanning forest. We conclude with an introduction to expanders as an example from spectral graph theory.
