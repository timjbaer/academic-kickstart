title: "Shopical: Shop Ethical"

summary: IBM Intern Hackthon 2020 
abstract: Environmental activists and researchers identified hundreds of chemicals and compounds that as harmful to our environment. The Shopical mobile app provides a way for consumers to check the sustainability of ingredients in beauty and food products in real-time. Users can scan the ingredients list of a product and instantly receive information about the environmentally harmful chemicals present. We hope that this will empower individuals to make purchases that are better for the environment. We won 2nd place in the climate change division (126 teams across 3 divisions).
